# Find-The-Judge

#So we are aware that in this problem, the one who is trusted by everyone is the judge, which means we are looking for the integer that is found N-1 time 
#in the graph. If found, we increment the count! If not, we decrememnt! Thenn at the end we compare to see who the judge will be!!!!
